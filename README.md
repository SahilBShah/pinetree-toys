# Eevee
Evolutionary program that uses PineTree to evolve genomes based on user's specifications.

To-Do:
1) Edit PineTree to normalize time stamps so that output files can be compared to one another more easily. This must be done so that we have a standardized version to calculate the average sum of squares per mutation proposed in order to reduce noise.
