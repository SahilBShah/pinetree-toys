# Pinetree-toys
Evolutionary program that uses PineTree to evolve genomes based on user's specifications.

If running on TACC determine number of cores present to maximize the amount of computing time available.

To-Do:
1) Edit PineTree to normalize time stamps so that output files can be compared to one another more easily. This must be done so that we have a standardized version to calculate the average sum of squares per mutation proposed in order to reduce noise.
2) Create Documentation.
3) Work on how to optimize program for usage on TACC.
